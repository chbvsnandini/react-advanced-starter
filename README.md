# React Advanced Starter

This project is a starter template demonstrating:

- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS for responsive UI
- Material UI (MUI) components
- Redux Toolkit + redux-observable (RxJS) for state management
- Apollo Client for GraphQL
- Axios for REST calls

Quick setup

1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended)
2. In this project directory run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

Notes

- I scaffolded the files manually because your environment blocked automatic scaffolding. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. If you want I can attempt to run installs for you now.
